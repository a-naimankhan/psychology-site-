Frontend Application

Production-ready frontend application developed by our team using a modern React-based stack.
The project follows best practices in structure, scalability, and maintainability.


🧩 Tech Stack

The application is built with:

React — component-based UI development

TypeScript — type safety and reliability

Vite — fast development and build tooling

Tailwind CSS — utility-first styling

shadcn/ui — reusable and customizable UI components

Built with a hybrid approach: Accelerated by Lovable for UI prototyping, with custom React/TypeScript logic and manual production deployment.
